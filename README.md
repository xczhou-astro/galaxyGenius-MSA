## Updates  

- 2025-10-27 (Big Update)  
1. Add support to input subhalo data file in h5 format (Please refer to `Examples/2-input_subhalo_file.py`).  
2. Add support to input extracted particles from subhalo (Please refer to `EAGLE/eagle.ipynb`).  
3. Add a singleton for unit conventions for various simulations (Please refer to `Examples/2-input_subhalo_file.py` for usage).  
4. Add logging for galaxyGenius routine.  

- 2025-07-01  
1. Add support for simulation mode of ExtinctionOnly (thanks comments from Maarten Baes, Qi Zeng, Andrea Gebek, Nick Andreads and members of SKIRT team.)  
    ExtinctionOnly is used when extinction and scattering of dust should be considered,  
    DustEmission is used when extinction and scattering along with secondary emission caused by dust should be considered,  
    NoMedium is an ideal case with no dust elements.  

- 2025-06-03  
1. Add support for deriving noise level from limiting magnitudes.  
2. Add support for estimating if galaxy is a spiral or not (Please use with caution).  

- 2025-05-30  
1. Add return code for `runSKIRT` in `generation.py`.  

- 2025-04-28  
1. Add support for viewRedshift.  
2. Bug several fixes.  

- 2025-04-22:   
1. Add support for local cosmology, and view distance for instrument.  
2. Add check for hydrodynamic solver: VoronoiMesh (TNG) and smoothParticle (EAGLE).  
3. Replace ExtinctionOnly simulation mode to NoMedium.  
4. Add support for field of view instead of setting it equal boxlength.  
5. Add support for only output SEDs.  

- 2025-02-20:  
1. Add check and retry features for requests to handle failure of Web-based API.  

## Dependence
Python verison:  
`python>=3.11`  

Python packages:
`tomlkit==0.13.2`  
`numpy==1.24.0` ⚠️  
`scipy==1.13.1`  
`matplotlib==3.9.2`  
`astropy==7.0.0` ⚠️  
`scikit-image==0.24.0`  
`joblib==1.4.2`  
`matplotlib_scalebar==0.8.1`  
`h5py==3.9.0` ⚠️  
`termcolor==2.4.0`  
`photutils==2.0.2`  
`requests==2.32.3`  

⚠️: Package versions should strictly match, otherwise there may be compatibility issues.

Other packages:  
[`illustris_python`](https://github.com/illustristng/illustris_python)  
[`SKIRT9`](https://skirt.ugent.be/root/_installation_guide.html)  

A new Python environment is recommended  

```Python
conda create -n galaxyGenius python=3.11  

conda activate galaxyGenius  

pip install .  
```  
`Data` directory should be set in environment, named `GALAXYGENIUS_DATA_DIR` or use
```Bash
export GALAXYGENIUS_DATA_DIR=/path/to/Data
```

## Recommended folder tree
```Bash
├── galaxyGenius/  
│   ├── Data/  
│   ├── galaxyGenius/  
│   ├── Notebooks/  
│   └── (workspace)/  
├── TNG100/  
│   ├── groups_N/  
│   │   ├── fof_subhalo_tab_N.n.hdf5  
│   │   └── ...  
│   └── snapdir_N/  
│       ├── snap_N.n.hdf5  
│       └── ...  
└── postprocessing/  
    └── offsets/  
        ├── offsets_N.hdf5  
        └── ...  
```
We also implement [Web-based API](https://www.tng-project.org/data/docs/api/) in `galaxyGenius`, therefore, users do not need to download the large snapshots and groups files. This feature can be activated by setting `requests=true` and provide users' `apiKey` in config. However, the generation speed will be slower and depends on the network speed.  

## Filters and PSFs
Filter throughputs and PSFs of specific surveys are saved in `Data/filters/(survey)` and `Data/PSFs/(survey)` directories.  
The format of filters are recommended to be plain text file with extension `.fil`, including two columns: wavelength (in angstrom) and throughputs.  
PSFs are recommended to be in `numpy.array`, and can be opened by `numpy.loadtxt` or `numpy.load`.  
Please make sure that the filters and PSFs exist in correct directories and formats before running galaxyGenius.

## Sky backgrounds  
Sky background noises are calculated based on the throughput of each filter and sky emission curve.  
We provide a helper notebook for calculation of instrumental noises in [Notebooks/calc_sky_bkg.ipynb](https://github.com/xczhou-astro/galaxyGenius/blob/main/Bkg/calc_sky_bkg.ipynb).  

## Usage
### Initialization
```Python
python init.py --workspace=workspace --surveys="CSST,HST"
```
`config.ini`, `config_CSST.ini` and `config_HST.ini` will be created in `workspace` directory. Please freely edit them as wish.  

if `surveys` are not specified, `postPostprocessing` will be set as False.

Currently, throughputs and PSFs of filters for CSST, HST, JWST, Roman and HSC are all uploaded. For Euclid, we only upload the filters, since the PSF files cannot be accessed.  

### Run
Enter workspace, and create a python file named `run.py`
```Python
# run.py

from galaxyGenius.config import Configuration
from galaxyGenius.generation import DataGeneration
from galaxyGenius.preprocess import PreProcess
from galaxyGenius.postprocess import PostProcess

config = Configuration() # initialize Configuration class
conf = config.get_config() # read config from current directory

preprocess = PreProcess(conf) # initialize PreProcess class
subhalos = preprocess.get_subhalos() # get subhalos 
subhaloIDs = subhalos['subhaloIDs'] # get subhaloIDs

for i, ID in enumerate(subhaloIDs):

    # Dynamically set parameters
    arguments = {}
    arguments['numPackets'] = 1e6

    if i < 100:
        arguments['numViews'] = 1
        arguments['inclinations'] = [0]
        arguments['azimuths'] = [0]
        arguments['faceAndEdge'] = False
    else:
        arguments['faceAndEdge'] = True


    preprocess.subhalo(subhaloID=ID) # get properties of subhalo
    preprocess.prepare(arguments) # prepare for simulation, including retrieving particles and creating .ski file

    dataGeneration = DataGeneration(config=conf) # initialize DataGeneration class
    dataGeneration.runSKIRT(skirtPATh='path/to/skirt') # run SKIRT, skirtPATH=None if skirt is in environment

    postprocess = PostProcess(subhaloID=ID) # initialize PostProcess class
    postprocess.runPostprocess() # run postprocessing
```  
then `python run.py`. 

Or you can interactively run in jupyter as illustrated in [Notebooks/tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/xczhou-astro/galaxyGenius/blob/main/Notebooks/tutorial.ipynb).  

### For hydrodynamical simulations except TNG

Necessary particle data and properties need to be created and saved in `workingDir (run)` in advance, and call `preprocess.inputs(data)` and subsequent methods to perform the galaxy generation. An example for EAGLE simulation is provided in [EAGLE/eagle.ipynb](https://github.com/xczhou-astro/galaxyGenius/blob/main/EAGLE/eagle.ipynb).  
data: `dict`  
`snapRedshift`, `cosmology`, `stellarMass`, `subhaloID`, `boxLength` keys are required.

### Outputs
`./dataCubes` includes the IFU-like raw dataCubes and SEDs of **SubhaloID** generated by SKIRT and auxiliary files.  
`./mock_CSST` includes the bandpass images and SEDs of **SubhaloID** for CSST.  
`./mock_HST` includes the bandpass images and SEDs of **SubhaloID** for HST.

```bash

Galaxy images in each band are saved in each extension of the fits file, and each extension includes images in different views.
